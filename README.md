This portfolio website was built from scratch using html, css, and javascript by me. It was a personal project, and I wanted to see how fast I could do it. I made this in 48 hours including eating, sleeping, going to work etc. It was a fun project!

This is a portfolio website highlighting milestones and details regarding career and academic achievements. I am planning on using this as my portfolio website while I look for jobs!
