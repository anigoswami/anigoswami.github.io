          <p>
            I am currently a Computer Engineering student in Academic Term 3 at Memorial Univeristy of Newfoundland.
            As I progress further in my life as an engineering student, I want to learn more and increase my knowledge
            to better help the society. I have a deep rooted passion for hardware as well as software. Building computers
            is something that I have been doing for a long time now. What started as a small time hobby, turned into a small 
            business, which grew into a passion and before I knew it, I was on a plane, to learn more about the crazy world of 
            hardware innovation. But that is not all! I've been learning software programming and have honed my skills in quite a 
            few languages (namely C++ and Java) which helped me realize the working principles of not only the hardware, but the software 
            which ties it all together. Being a fast learner has helped me in my journey of acquiring more knowledge, and I hope to continue 
            doing so, as I transition from being a student to a professional engineer.
